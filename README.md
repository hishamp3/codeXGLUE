# codeXGLUE
CodeXGLUE, a benchmark dataset to foster machine learning research for program understanding and generation. CodeXGLUE includes a collection of 10 tasks across 14 datasets and a platform for model evaluation and comparison. Defect detection notebook tries to achieve the results showcased in the original paper of CodeXGLUE for detecting any vulnerable C code using CodeBERT model with RoBERTa baseline.
